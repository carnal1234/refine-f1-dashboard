# Project Title



I love watching Formula 1 and it is amazing to see how data work with the sport. 

So I have an idea to visualize  data such as race pace, stint etc with [OpenF1](https://openf1.org/) API with interactive dashboard.

The project is still under development and any good idea is appreciated.













## Installation

Install react with npm

```bash
  npm install 
  cd refine-f1-dashboard
  npm install 
```


To run the project


```bash
    npm run dev
```



    
## Demo

[Here](https://refine-f1-dashboard-122abq912-tszs-projects.vercel.app) is the project deployed on Vercel.

Keep in mind that OpenF1 is under development and race data is only available between 2023 - 2024.


## Roadmap

- Race Pace with laptime.

- Race Strategy for each driver (Stint)

- Position Changes throughout a race

- Race Event like Safety Car, Weather, DNF etc

- Minor Detail like pit stop, practice or starting grid.
